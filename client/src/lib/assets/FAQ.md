**What is this?**

This is a Frequency Testnet faucet based on Polkadot's testnet faucet. You can use this to load testnet tokens into your account.

**What is a faucet?**

A faucet is a developer tool to get a small amount of testnet tokens (XRQCY) in order to test and troubleshoot a decentralized application or protocol before going live on Frequency, where one must use real FRQCY.

Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet. The Frequency faucet is free, fast, and does not require authentication.

**How do I use this?**

To request funds, simply enter your Frequency Testnet wallet address, fill the captcha, and hit "Submit".
<br><br>

**How much XRQCY will I receive?**

You will receive 5000 XRQCY per request.
<br><br>

**How often can I request tokens?**

You can request tokens every 24h! If you request XRQCY for one account, you can't request more for that address.
<br><br>

**What is a testnet token?**

Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Frequency application before going live. Testnet tokens can be used in place of real tokens on testnets like Rococo.
