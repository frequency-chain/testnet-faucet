**What is this?**

This is a Frequency Testnet faucet based on Polkadot's testnet faucet. You can use this to load testnet tokens into your account.

**What is a faucet?**

A faucet is a developer tool to get a small amount of testnet tokens (XRQCY) in order to test and troubleshoot a decentralized application or protocol before going live on Frequency, where one must use real FRQCY.

Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet. The Frequency faucet is free, fast, and does not require authentication.
<br><br>

**How do I use this?**

To request funds, simply enter your Frequency Testnet wallet address, fill the captcha, and hit "Submit".
<br><br>

**How much XRQCY will I receive?**

You will receive 5000 XRQCY per request.
<br><br>

**How often can I request tokens?**

You can request tokens every 24h! If you request XRQCY for one account, you can't request more for that address.
<br><br>

**What is a testnet token?**

Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Frequency application before going live. Testnet tokens can be used in place of real tokens on testnets like Rococo.
<br><br>

**What is the balance cap and why am I getting a balance cap error?**

The faucet has a balance cap limit to ensure fair distribution of testnet tokens. The balance caps are:
- Frequency Paseo Testnet: 1000 XRQCY (with drip amount of 5000 XRQCY per request)
- Paseo: 500 PAS (with drip amount of 100 PAS per request)

If your wallet's balance exceeds the cap for the respective network, you won't be able to request more tokens. If you need more tokens for testing, consider creating a new wallet address or using your existing tokens more efficiently.
